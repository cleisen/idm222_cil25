            <p class="euronews__intro">Euronews.com is a news site that provides an international view, giving a new and different perspective. The main goal of their site is to 
            deliver a neutral and objective view of the world&apos;s news to everyone. This is important to their brand as the users who visit the Euronews 
            website are from across the globe. Below is a user persona that I used as a reference throughout the design process which highlights certain 
            goals a user of Euronews may have.</p>

            <div class="subheading first">planning</div>
        <div class="subheading2">Immediate Goals</div>
            <p>After quickly reviewing the home & article pages, I Immediately knew that there were some organizational and overcrowding issues.</p>

            <img src="images/euronews-cs/article-ss.jpg" alt="article-ss" class="imgbottom2">

            <p>I then took the skeleton of each of the pages and made content wireframes to get an idea of how everything was organized.</p>
            <p>As you can tell, there is a lot going on. However, before I could determine the main issues I wanted to address in my redesign, 
                I decided to perform an in-depth analysis in order to figure out the leading problems.</p>

         <div class="subheading2">Heuristic Evaluation Process</div>   
            <p>Through a heuristic evaluation process, a peer and I rated certain elements of the Euronews website on a scale of 0-4 on their success. 
                Things that scored a zero were deemed a usability catastrophe and were imperative to fix before the design could be released. Design elements 
                that scored a four were believed to not have a usability problem at all.</p>
            <p>As seen in the image below, the areas that had the most issues were the navigation of the site, the home page, the visual design, 
                and the user task orientation.</p>
            <p>After evaluating the results and looking back on my user persona, I combined all of the biggest issues and made a list of my main goals for the 
                redesign of Euronews. (seen below)</p>

        <div class="subheading2">Sketching/Wireframing Process</div>
            <p>In an effort to give Euronews a specific identity, I wanted to incorporate circles into the design. The idea was to resemble a globe 
                and tie in the focus of world news in an intriguing way.</p>
            <p>During my wireframe sketching process, I did some research along the way. I took ideas from different websites and noticed how they 
                accomplished designs that were simple, intuitive, and unique. In my sketches, I combined my ideas and my research and came up with 16 different 
                layout options.</p>
            <p>I also focused on creating the designs to be responsive between desktop, tablet, and mobile interfaces. Here are a couple of my favorites:</p>

            <img src="images/euronews-cs/sketch-1.jpg" alt="sketch-1" class="imgtop">
            <img src="images/euronews-cs/sketch-2.jpg" alt="sketch-2" class="imgbottom2">

                <div class="subheading2">Final Sketches</div>
                    
                        <img src="images/euronews-cs/final-sketch.jpg" alt="final-sketch" class="imgboth">
                        <p>I chose this sketch as my final design because it has a good balance of simplicity, creativity, and organization. 
                            The articles displayed on the home page are well balanced, but maintain a hierarchy for the lead article. The home page is also 
                            organized in a fashion that is uncluttered and continues to contain all the information needed for quick navigation, which was one 
                            of the main issues on the original site.</p>
                   
                    
                <div class="subheading2">Color Theme</div>
                    
                        <img src="images/euronews-cs/color-theme.jpg" alt="color-theme" class="imgcolor">
                        <p>Euronews&apos; core values are focused on honesty, integrity, and neutrality. In order to create a color palette that would 
                            reflect those ideas into a visceral feeling for the users, I stuck with variations of blue throughout the design as it is a color of 
                            trust, loyalty, and logic.</p>
                        <p>For the secondary colors, each topic was assigned its own bright color to add variation and easy identification of 
                            groupings.</p>

        <div class="subheading2">Key Elements</div>
            <img src="images/euronews-cs/before&after.jpg" alt="before&after" class="imgboth">
            <p>In the end, my final designs had reached the goals I set out to accomplish. The visual design, the organization, and the navigation are much 
                more intuitive and engaging as a whole.</p>
            <p>Looking at the video walkthroughs of the final designs, it is apparent that the search function is now easily accessible and 
                consistently in the same relative space within each different dimension. This is helpful so users can easily move between devices without needing 
                to relearn a different way of finding information that needs to be quickly accessed. </p>
            <p>In continuing to follow my user personas goals for the site, I decided to add an interactive way for users to navigate to the news they want by 
                country. First, they click or tap on the continent they want to find news on, and it will guide them to a country list within that continent. 
                This allows users to have another place to search for the news they want but in a more advanced and interactive way.</p>
            <p>Another small, but very important, key element in the final design is the language choosing tab. Because Euronews is a world news site that 
                broadcasts in 13 different languages, I felt that it was necessary to work this into my design on each of the homepages so users can easily 
                change it as soon as they open the site.</p>
            <p>One of the major changes in design was that I completely got rid of the endless list of articles on the original homepage, and simply organized 
                all of the articles by topics. These topics are accessible in the top menu as well as the bottom of the homepage. I believe that the original site 
                was overcrowded, which interrupted navigation for users. Now, the user can either be influenced to choose one of the lead articles advertised at 
                the top of the page, or if they are searching for news on a certain topic, they can quickly go there as well. </p>

        <div class="subheading2">Final Heuristic Evaluation Results</div>
            <p>After completing the final redesign of Euronews, a peer and I did the same heuristic evaluation as before, but this time on the new site to get 
                an idea of how much the site&apos;s issues improved or didn&apos;t.</p>
            <p>As seen in the image above, all of the major issues with the original site were drastically changed for the better in the redesign.</p>
