            <h1>overview</h1>
            RightOn! is a math classroom app that engages students in thinking 
            about and discussing not only correct answers, but incorrect answers 
            as well. This allows students to embrace mistakes and misconceptions, 
            increasing self-confidence and deepening conceptual understanding.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="">the problem</h1>
            <div class="">
                When joining the RightOn team, it was clear that their 
                mobile app was in its beginning stages, with only functionality 
                in mind, ignoring the users&apos; experience. It lacked cohesiveness 
                and the visual design was not engaging enough for the intended 
                audience - middle and high school math students.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="">goal</h1>
            <div class="">
                Enhance the RightOn student experience by increasing engagement 
                & ease of use.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="">challenges</h1>
            <div class="">
                Time was the biggest challenge during this project. I was typically 
                assigned many projects to work on simultaneously including working 
                on the teacher facing app, the company website, and outreach to 
                educators. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It was also difficult not having as much time as we hoped to do 
                testing in schools since we were working during students&apos; 
                summer break. As a result, we needed to come up with alternative
                 methods to gather data from students.

            <h2 class="h2center"> - Conducting Individual Lab Testing with 9 Students - </h2>

            <h2>01 - Beginning User Interviews</h2>
            We connected the pre-existing high-fidelity screens into an interactive 
            prototype to test with, and wrote questions about the current game&apos;s 
            usability
            <img src="images/righton-cs/first-prototype.png" class="one_image" alt="first-prototype">
            We started by asking questions about every major step of the pre-existing
             process, and listened for any other pain points the students had
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Findings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <li>Question/answer layout was confusing</li>
                    <li>General confusion because most ignored the instructions</li>
                    <li>Some students gave responses relating to the question 
                        material vs the experience of playing</li>
                </div>
            </ul>

            <h2>02 - Getting Advice</h2>
            After our first couple of student interviews, our team wanted to 
            improve our analysis questions, so we sought out the expertise of a 
            cognitive science/ux researcher to help us gather our data in the most 
            effective way.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Results:</h4>
            <ul>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <li>Learned to utilize open ended questions, a visual likert 
                        scale (google form), & the differences in testing 
                        attitudinal vs behavioral research</li>
                    <li>We continued to meet with our research mentor, a 
                        UX designer, and 2 teachers who helped us improve our 
                        user testing skills and focus the direction of the project</li>
                </div>
            </ul>

            <h2>03 - Iterative Testing w/ More Narrow Focus</h2>
            After changing our questions a bit, we continued to receive more 
            thoughtful responses from students.
            <br>
            <br>
            With continued interviews, we used our findings to keep iterating 
            new questions and interactive prototypes.

            <h4>Findings:</h4>

            <h2>01 - Create New Prototype to Test Solutions from Findings</h2>
            With an in-person classroom setting we wanted to not only confirm some 
            of the discovered pain points from previous interviews, but also test 
            possible solutions for them.

            4. See how the monsters engage them
            <br>
            5. Gain additional feedback/suggestions
            </div>
            
            <h2>02 - Perform the Usability Test</h2>
            <h4>Our Setup:</h4>
            <div class="bullets">
                <li>2 different classes</li>
                <li>45 minutes per class</li>
                <li>35 students per class</li>
                <li>6 devices</li>
                <li>3 UX Interns</li>
                <li>1 smartboard</li>
                <li>Students&apos; personal devices</li>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            To watch the students&apos; genuine reactions and thought-processes, 
            we did small group testings where each individual played through 
            the prototype. They then scanned the presented QR code that led them 
            to our google form questionnaire, and us interviewers could move to 
            the next group.
            <br>
            <img src="/images/righton-cs/me-students.png"></img>
            Finally, we had a group discussion at the end to talk about any other 
            feedback they wanted to share apart from the google form.
