            <h1>overview</h1>
            RightOn! is a math classroom app that engages students in thinking 
            about and discussing not only correct answers, but incorrect answers 
            as well. This allows students to embrace mistakes and misconceptions, 
            increasing self-confidence and deepening conceptual understanding.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="">the problem</h1>
            <div class="">
                When joining the RightOn team, it was clear that their 
                mobile app was in its beginning stages, with only functionality 
                in mind, ignoring the users&apos; experience. It lacked cohesiveness 
                and the visual design was not engaging enough for the intended 
                audience - middle and high school math students.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="">goal</h1>
            <div class="">
                Enhance the RightOn student experience by increasing engagement 
                & ease of use.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="">challenges</h1>
            <div class="">
                Time was the biggest challenge during this project. I was typically 
                assigned many projects to work on simultaneously including working 
                on the teacher facing app, the company website, and outreach to 
                educators. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It was also difficult not having as much time as we hoped to do 
                testing in schools since we were working during students&apos; 
                summer break. As a result, we needed to come up with alternative
                 methods to gather data from students.

            <h2>01 - Beginning User Interviews</h2>
            We connected the pre-existing high-fidelity screens into an interactive 
            prototype to test with, and wrote questions about the current game&apos;s 
            usability
            <img src="images/righton-cs/first-prototype.png" class="one_image" alt="first-prototype">
            We started by asking questions about every major step of the pre-existing
             process, and listened for any other pain points the students had
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Findings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <li>Question/answer layout was confusing</li>
                    <li>General confusion because most ignored the instructions</li>
                    <li>Some students gave responses relating to the question 
                        material vs the experience of playing</li>
                </div>
            </ul>

            <h2>02 - Getting Advice</h2>
            After our first couple of student interviews, our team wanted to 
            improve our analysis questions, so we sought out the expertise of a 
            cognitive science/ux researcher to help us gather our data in the most 
            effective way.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Results:</h4>
            <ul>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <li>Learned to utilize open ended questions, a visual likert 
                        scale (google form), & the differences in testing 
                        attitudinal vs behavioral research</li>
                    <li>We continued to meet with our research mentor, a 
                        UX designer, and 2 teachers who helped us improve our 
                        user testing skills and focus the direction of the project</li>
                </div>
            </ul>

            <h2>03 - Iterative Testing w/ More Narrow Focus</h2>
            After changing our questions a bit, we continued to receive more 
            thoughtful responses from students.
            <br>
            <br>
            With continued interviews, we used our findings to keep iterating 
            new questions and interactive prototypes.

            <h4>Findings:</h4>

            <h2>01 - Create New Prototype to Test Solutions from Findings</h2>
            With an in-person classroom setting we wanted to not only confirm some 
            of the discovered pain points from previous interviews, but also test 
            possible solutions for them.

            <h2>02 - Perform the Usability Test</h2>
            
            <h4>Our Setup:</h4>
            <ul>
                <div class="bullets">
                <li>2 different classes</li>
                <li>45 minutes per class</li>
                <li>35 students per class</li>
                <li>6 devices</li>

                <li>Students&apos; personal devices</li>
            </div>

                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    To watch the students&apos; genuine reactions and thought-processes, 
                    we did small group testings where each individual played through 
                    the prototype. They then scanned the presented QR code that led them 
                    to our google form questionnaire, and us interviewers could move to 
                    the next group.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <br>
            
            Finally, we had a group discussion at the end to talk about any other 
            feedback they wanted to share apart from the google form.
            <img src="images/righton-cs/me-class.png" class="one_image" alt="me w/ class"></img>

            <h2>03 - Analyze Data, Identify Trends</h2>
            We asked 12 survey questions to 41 students
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <div class="data">
                <div class="answer">
                    65% of students said the instructions were not very clear
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    “Make me pay attention in some way, I skipped past it too 
                    easily”
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    “My favorite thing about the RightOn app is the little monsters”
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    71% of students said they would prefer to see both an 
                    individual and top 5 leaderboard
                </div>
            </div>
                
            
            <br>
            <br>
            Patterns we noticed when watching the students in the first class 
            interact with the prototype:
            <ul>
                <div class="bullets">
                <li>Confusion about what they were supposed to be doing</li>
                <li>Still some slight confusion about the question/answer swipe layout</li>
                <li>The new leaderboard got them excited and increased motivation</li>
                <li>Gaps in the flow where the users have to wait caused disengagement</li>
            </div>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Surprising Results</h4>
            Conducted A/B testing with 1: new layout idea and 2: the original layout

            <br>
            Even though we thought the new design was more intuitive, there were a 
            mix of things that proved our opinion wrong:

                1. In the case of long word problems, students preferred the 2

                2. Students enjoyed how it challenged them to think of their own 
                    answer before seeing the options

                 - When first detecting the card swipe motion as a point of 
                 confusion, we had mainly conducted testing via zoom. Because 
                 our subjects used the figma prototype with a mousepad, it 
                 didn&apos;t perfectly simulate how it would be typically used 
                 on a mobile device.

            <h2>Question/Answer Layout</h2>
            Since there was still slight confusion, we tested adding small arrows 
            to the cards to signify that there is something else there to see.

                    Because swiping is a natural motion for mobile users, the 
                    students got the hang of it super easily, and the arrows 
                    helped to nudge those still unsure.

            <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
            In the original leaderboard flow, those who didn&apos;t land in the top 5, 
            received no personal feedback and ended the game feeling negatively 
            about themselves.

            Following RightOn&apos;s mission to promote a positive culture of error, 
            we found a solution that would:
